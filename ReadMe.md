# LlamaPlugins
This repo contains a set of plugins designed for RebornBuddy.

## Installation

### Automatic Setup

The easiest way to install LlamaPlugins is to install the [UpdateBuddy](https://loader.updatebuddy.net/UpdateBuddy.zip) plugin. It would be installed in the **/plugins** folder of your RebornBuddy folder. It will automatically install the files into the correct folders.

### Manual Setup

For those of you that don't want to use [UpdateBuddy](https://loader.updatebuddy.net/UpdateBuddy.zip) here's the manual installation method.

Download the zip from [LlamaPlugins](https://github.com/nt153133/LlamaPlugins) and create a folder in **/Plugins** called **LlamaPlugins** and either unzip the contents of the zip into that folder, or check out using a git client to that folder.

After Install your folder structure should look something like this.
```
RebornBuddy
└── Plugins
     └── LlamaPlugins
```
